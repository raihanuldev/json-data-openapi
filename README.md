# JSON Data OpenAPI

## Overview

JSON Data OpenAPI is a project aimed at providing a standardized OpenAPI specification for JSON data formats. The goal is to create a reusable and easily understandable specification that developers can use to describe JSON data structures and schemas in their APIs.

## Features

- **Standardized Specification**: Provides a standardized OpenAPI specification for describing JSON data formats.
- **Reusable**: The specification can be easily reused across different APIs and projects.
- **Easy Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with existing OpenAPI tooling and workflows.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation to guide developers in utilizing the specification effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with JSON Data OpenAPI, follow these steps:

1. **Explore the API Endpoints**: The project's API endpoint is [https://raihanuldev.github.io/json-data-openapi/](https://raihanuldev.github.io/json-data-openapi/). To access specific JSON data, append the filename to the base URL. For example:
   - [https://raihanuldev.github.io/json-data-openapi/news.json](https://raihanuldev.github.io/json-data-openapi/news.json)
   - [https://raihanuldev.github.io/json-data-openapi/blogs.json](https://raihanuldev.github.io/json-data-openapi/blogs.json)

2. **Integrate with Your API**: Integrate the specification into your API by referencing it in your OpenAPI definition file.

3. **Contribute**: If you'd like to contribute to JSON Data OpenAPI, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
